## About
After a long time of learning to code and design. I planned on making my first visual prescence online thereby designing and developing my first portfolio site. I have made some projects and still making some to improve myself, though i've been learning and following some tutorials on the web and adding my own skills and touches to it. Well, my main objectives were to understand web designing and also pushing my work to git/github. I know i will do more better on my next portfolio project.

## Things I Learned
* UI/UX Design - Understanding the interactions between users and web applications helps a developer on the concept of design flows and solidifies our understanding of web designs and development. I think every developer should also design.
* Figma - Figma laid a basic foundation of web development and structure starting from the header to links to banners; down to the footer. Through some lessons i was able understand more about frontend production.
* Emailjs - I never knew about this until i was searching on how to receive emails directly with no backend syntax; I can say that JavaScript could solve as many backend productions as we think. I beleive in JavaScript.
* Html,Css,JavaScript - All these are important in frontend production, doing this project an the more i have done have deepen my insight on their creation, interactions and comparisons.

## Problems I Encountered
There were errors that pop up during this project creation; some of them were:
* I had problems with some styles especially during its responsiveness across various screen width, but i kept playing the codes until they got fixed.
* The Emailjs failed to load due to my negligence of declaring some variables apropriately in order.

## Credits
I want to give credits and a lot of thanks to all my inspirers and mentors. I couldn't have done this without you!.

## Run
* Clone the repo or download the Zip and run the index.html file.
